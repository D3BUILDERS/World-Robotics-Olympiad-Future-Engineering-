## INTRODUCTION

We are Team D3 Builders from the Robotronics Club of Ahmedabad. Being part of this club gives us the chance to really explore robotics, coding, and engineering in a hands-on way. With the support of our mentors, teachers, and a well-equipped lab, we get to turn our ideas into actual working robots. Each of us brings in different strengths—whether it’s designing, programming, or problem-solving—and together we make a strong team. Building this robot for the WRO competition has been an amazing experience where we’ve learned a lot, challenged ourselves, and grown as innovators.

## ELECTRICAL PROCESSES

## Power Distribution

The entire robot runs on two 18650 Li-ion batteries rated at 3.7V each. These batteries were chosen because they are lightweight but provide enough current for the Raspberry Pi, motors, and sensors. I positioned the batteries at the bottom of the chassis so the weight was evenly balanced and the robot would not tip over when moving. Since I did not use a voltage regulator, I had to carefully check that each component received the correct voltage directly from the batteries. The Raspberry Pi and motor driver were both connected in a way that avoided unnecessary power loss. I also kept the jumper wires as short as possible so that less energy was wasted in transmission.

## Signal Flow

The Raspberry Pi 4 acted as the brain of the system. It collected input data from the Pi Camera and the VL53L1X distance sensor, then processed it to make decisions about movement. After processing, the Pi sent electrical signals to the TB6612FNG motor driver and the servo motor. The distance sensor communicated with the Pi using the I²C protocol, which is like a two-wire digital conversation system where one wire carries data and the other synchronizes it. The motors and the servo, on the other hand, were controlled using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals. By changing how long each pulse stayed high or low, I could adjust the motor speed or the servo’s turning angle very precisely.

## Motor Control

The TB6612FNG motor driver was a key part of the robot’s electrical system. The Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins cannot supply enough current to drive motors directly, so the motor driver acted as an amplifier. It took the weak control signals from the Raspberry Pi and boosted them into stronger currents that could actually power the DC motors. By using PWM signals, I could smoothly vary the speed of the wheels, make the robot accelerate or decelerate, and even bring it to a controlled stop instead of a sudden halt. This made the robot’s motion look much more natural and car-like.

## Sensor Connections

The VL53L1X distance sensor was connected to the Raspberry Pi through the SDA and SCL pins that handle I²C communication. This sensor allowed the robot to measure how far away obstacles were and react before collisions happened. The Pi Camera 3 was connected through a flat ribbon cable to the dedicated CSI port on the Raspberry Pi. Together, the camera and the distance sensor gave the robot both vision and depth awareness. Both sensors were powered by the same battery source, so it was important that all ground pins were connected properly. Without a common ground, the signals could become unstable or unreliable.

## Safety and Reliability

Because no voltage regulator was used in this setup, I had to make sure the components were always operating within safe voltage limits. To do this, I ensured that the jumper wires were firmly connected so they would not loosen during movement. I also avoided long or tangled wiring to reduce resistance and power drops. The 18650 Li-ion batteries provided enough current so that even if the motors drew more power during acceleration, the Raspberry Pi did not shut down or restart unexpectedly. This stability was very important because a sudden restart could stop the robot in the middle of a test.

## Step-by-Step Assembly

The electrical connections were assembled in stages to avoid mistakes. First, I connected the motor driver to the DC motors and tested simple forward and backward movement using basic code. Once this was working, I added the servo motor for steering and wrote small test programs to check the turning angles. After confirming the steering worked, I connected the VL53L1X distance sensor and tested distance readings. Then I installed the Pi Camera with the ribbon cable and ensured that the Raspberry Pi detected it correctly. Finally, I connected the power supply through the batteries and tested the full system together. This step-by-step approach made it easier to identify wiring errors and fix them early instead of troubleshooting everything at once.

Our robot uses carefully chosen components to make it precise, reliable, and capable of completing the WRO course efficiently. The main chassis is a Lego Technic base, which is strong, modular, and easy to modify, allowing us to adjust the design as needed during testing. The movement of the robot is powered by two DC motors, controlled by a TB6612FNG motor driver. These motors provide smooth and precise motion, while the motor driver allows the Raspberry Pi to adjust speed and direction using PWM signals.

For steering, we use a servo motor mounted on the front axle, giving the robot accurate and responsive turning ability. To detect walls and obstacles, we installed VL53L1X distance sensors, with two on the sides for wall-following and one at the front to measure distances to obstacles ahead. These sensors communicate with the Raspberry Pi through I2C, providing real-time distance data for navigation.

The robot’s brain is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, which processes sensor data, runs the obstacle detection program, and handles image processing from the Pi Camera 3. The camera captures live images of the course, detects colored blocks, and tracks lines, allowing the robot to make intelligent navigation decisions. All of these components are powered by 3.7V 18650 Li-ion batteries, providing enough energy for multiple rounds of the competition. A voltage regulator ensures that the Raspberry Pi receives stable and safe power while the motors and sensors draw from the same battery source.

Together, these components create a reliable, efficient, and autonomous robot capable of performing complex navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks in real time. Each part was selected and positioned carefully to work in harmony, ensuring smooth performance during the competition.

## Mobility Management
## Core Design

The entire mobility system of our robot was built around a car-like steering model instead of the usual skid steering used in many robots. We felt this approach gave our design a more realistic feel and also smoother turns on the WRO field. The main chassis was built with Lego Technic beams, which made it both lightweight and modular. Since we were new to WRO, the Lego-based frame gave us flexibility—whenever we faced problems, we could rebuild or adjust sections quickly. For propulsion, we used two DC motors at the rear, connected through the TB6612FNG motor driver. The rear wheels provided the driving force, while the front wheels were mounted on a servo-controlled axle for steering. This separation of driving and steering made the robot more predictable and stable, especially during alignment tasks and when taking curves.

## Sensor Placement and Functionality

For the robot to navigate and react to its surroundings, we placed sensors carefully in positions where they could give the most useful data. The Pi Camera 3 was mounted in the front so it could detect lines and capture what lay ahead of the robot. This camera acted as the main “eye” of the system. Alongside it, the VL53L1X time-of-flight distance sensor was positioned to detect obstacles and walls in close range. To strengthen navigation, we also experimented with placing VL53L1X sensors on the sides so the robot could measure distances from boundaries and adjust its course accordingly. This combination allowed the robot to stay in its lane, avoid crashing, and follow the intended path on the field. Each sensor was chosen not only for accuracy but also for speed, since in competitions the robot has to make decisions within fractions of a second.

## Steering Mechanism

The steering mechanism was one of the most important parts of the robot. Instead of using skid steering where two motors drive opposite sides, we relied on a front-mounted servo motor that physically turned the wheels left and right. This gave the robot car-like steering, which is both smoother and easier to control in narrow spaces. The servo was calibrated so that even small movements in angle created noticeable turns, but without making the robot unstable. This precision made it possible to take clean curves and align accurately with objects on the field. At the same time, the rear DC motors were synced with the steering commands so the robot would always maintain a balance between speed and turning. The biggest advantage of this setup was stability—unlike skid steering, our robot didn’t “drag” wheels while turning, which reduced friction and saved power.

## Power Supply

To power the whole robot, we decided to use 3.7V 18650 Li-ion batteries. These batteries were reliable, rechargeable, and light enough not to weigh the robot down. Since the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, motors, and sensors all needed stable power, we had to plan the wiring carefully. The Pi was the most sensitive part, as it required consistent current and voltage. To make sure it didn’t drop power mid-run, we balanced the load so that the motors and servo didn’t interfere with it. The batteries were wired using jumper wires, which kept the connections neat and easy to manage. Even though we didn’t use a voltage regulator, the system performed well because of proper distribution and placement of batteries. One of the key things we learned here was how important battery stability is for a robot—without reliable power, even the best code or hardware won’t run properly.

## Assembly Instructions

The assembly of the mobility system was done step by step to make sure everything aligned properly. First, the Lego beams were arranged to form a stable rectangular base. The Raspberry Pi was mounted in the center to act as the brain of the system and to keep the weight balanced. Next, the motor driver was fixed near the rear motors so the connections would be short and reduce energy loss. The servo was attached to the front axle to control steering directly, and the front wheels were secured tightly to respond to even small servo movements. The Pi Camera was positioned at the front with a clear view of the track, while the VL53L1X sensors were placed at the front and sides for maximum coverage. Finally, the Li-ion batteries were secured at the bottom of the chassis to keep the center of gravity low, which reduced wobbling when the robot moved at higher speeds. All components were connected using jumper wires, which gave us the flexibility to make changes quickly if needed.
