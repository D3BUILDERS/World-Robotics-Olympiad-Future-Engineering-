INTRODUCTION

We are Team D3 Builders from the Robotronics Club of Ahmedabad. Being part of this club gives us the chance to really explore robotics, coding, and engineering in a hands-on way. With the support of our mentors, teachers, and a well-equipped lab, we get to turn our ideas into actual working robots. Each of us brings in different strengths—whether it’s designing, programming, or problem-solving—and together we make a strong team. Building this robot for the WRO competition has been an amazing experience where we’ve learned a lot, challenged ourselves, and grown as innovators.

ABOUT THE TEAM

[Deyaan Agrawal – Grade 12]
Deyaan is our team leader and the one handling all the software for the robot. He loves Legos, which made him suggest building a chassis that we could easily change or adjust—something really helpful since this was our first WRO competition. He writes the code that controls the robot, programs the sensors, and makes sure it can react quickly to obstacles. He’s always testing and improving the robot so it moves smoothly and does exactly what it’s supposed to. Deyaan also keeps the team organized and focused, making sure everyone stays on track while building the robot.

[Darsh Zaveri – Grade 10]
Darsh handles the GitHub repository and project journaling, keeping track of every idea, test, and change the team makes. This way, nothing gets lost, and the team can always look back to see what worked and what didn’t. Darsh also makes sure all progress is documented properly so that it’s easy to explain the work to mentors or judges. His efforts help the team stay organized and make sure the project runs smoothly.

[Dhruv Patel – Grade 11]
Dhruv is in charge of the hardware. He makes sure the chassis is strong, the motors are mounted properly, and the sensors are in the right positions. He keeps testing and adjusting the mechanical parts so the robot can turn sharply, move steadily, and complete the course without problems. His focus on details makes sure that the robot is not only smart on the inside but also tough and reliable on the outside.

Together, as Team D3 Builders, the team brings skills in software, organization, and hardware together. They work as a team, solve problems collaboratively, and make sure the robot can handle anything the competition throws at it.
