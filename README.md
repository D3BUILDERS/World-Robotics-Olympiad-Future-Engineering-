# World-Robotics-Olympiad-Future-Engineering-


## INTRODUCTION

We are Team D3 Builders from the Robotronics Club of Ahmedabad. Being part of this club gives us the chance to really explore robotics, coding, and engineering in a hands-on way. With the support of our mentors, teachers, and a well-equipped lab, we get to turn our ideas into actual working robots. Each of us brings in different strengths—whether it’s designing, programming, or problem-solving—and together we make a strong team. Building this robot for the WRO competition has been an amazing experience where we’ve learned a lot, challenged ourselves, and grown as innovators.
